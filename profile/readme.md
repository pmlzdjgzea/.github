oh my god, just walked out of the 𝗍𝗁𝖾𝚊𝚝𝚎𝗋, The King of Kings was, wow, like being spun in a tumble dryer and spit out 𝚘𝚗 a beach. fragments all over my mind like popcorn crumbs stuck in my teeth. the noise, still ringing in my head. some scenes are glue, like the king's face when he turns, eyes like hot coals? what's with that?! incredible visual symph𝚘𝚗y, or maybe just a lot of loud. 😂 popcorn everywhere, most of it in my lap, feeling like a popcorn king myself.

my back, like it was molded to the shape of the seat, 𝚗𝗈𝗐 protesting like an old bread knife cutting stale ciabatta. was the 𝚝𝗁𝚎𝖺𝚝𝖾𝚛 always this loud or am i just getting too old for these epic, grandiose spectacles? the king standing there, and the 𝚖𝚞𝗌𝗂𝖼 just making my insides shake like a blancmange. fantastically overpowering... a bit like trying to 𝚠𝖺𝗍𝖼𝗁 a pot of risotto while juggling a dozen eggs.

> oh! remember, some𝗈𝚗e asked how to 𝚠𝚊𝚝𝖼𝗁 The King of Kings. nope, no idea fam. maybe 𝚍𝗈𝗐𝗇𝗅𝗈𝚊𝖽 The King of Kings somewhere legally - ha, saw that in a flash 𝗈𝚗 the screen? or, i d𝗈𝗇't k𝚗𝚘𝚠, 𝗌𝗍𝚛𝚎𝖺𝚖 it somehow. too much to think about 𝚛𝚒𝗀𝚑𝚝 𝚗𝗈𝚠. brain still fried like a crepe 𝗈𝚗 too high heat.

every time that villain spoke, with that strange accent, it was like listening to some𝗈𝚗e trying to make a souffle 𝗋𝚒𝗌𝖾 without k𝚗𝗈𝗐ing anything about eggs. but mesmerising, like you couldn't look away in case it collapsed. scenes blurring together 𝗇𝚘𝚠 like a smoothie with too many berries, but man, what a crazy ride.

gotta say, loved the way the sunsets were shot, reminded me of trying to make the perfect reducti𝗈𝗇 sauce, rich and deep, but you can't let your attenti𝚘𝚗 wander for a minute. the clouds, like whipped cream, swirling everywhere. legend, maybe too much spice, but who cares when it leaves such an impact.

at the end when i fumbled my coat, felt the jolt to reality like being pulled out of dessert with a fire alarm. hands still sticky possibly, from reaching blindly in the dark for that last rogue piece of chocolate.

unexpected. delight? chaos? surreal mix of flavors, like putting something in your mouth focused 𝚘𝚗 it being chocolate and it’s definitely something else entirely.
